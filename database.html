        <p class="projecttext">
            With this database i first started working with PHP in combination with HTML and css. <br>
            This was a whole new expierence because i had to send the user information to a database to access it someweere else. <br>
            This was allot of fun because i could now use the user information to display somewere else. <br>
            Working with PHP and databases was more difficult to understand than the other coding languages we've had so far. <br>
            I also added some styling to the webpage to make it look a little bit better.
