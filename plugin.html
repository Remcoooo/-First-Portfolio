        <p class="projecttext">
            I started working on the custom recipe for my backpack. <br>
            If you put this in the crafting table you get a normal minecraft item wit a different recipe. <br>
            Because of this i had the abillity to make my own item with custom name and lore <br>
            to this item i could attach the backpack GUI. <br>
            Only with this specific made item you could open the GUI.
        </p>
        <p class="projecttext2">
            Here i make sure that the right GUI is connected to the right backpack. <br>
            The console also looks to what item the player holds if this is the right item <br>
            with name and lore of the custom item you can open the GUI of the backpack.
        </p>
        <p class="projecttext3">
            The GUI of the backpack plugin is safed here, so everytime the player opens his <br>
            backpack the same stuff is still in there. I used a Hashmap for this, <br>
            this makes sure that if the server stops that all the items in the GUI are getting saved to the config, <br>
            if the server reboots the config is loaded and the player recieves his items in the backpack.
        </p>
        <p class="projecttext4">
            I also made my own command so if the players types in the chat <br>
            he gets info about the backpack plugin.
        </p>
        <p class="projecttext5">
            I made sure that the model of my backpack looked different than a normal minecraft item, <br>
            i made my own model and imported it to the server.
        </p>
        <p class="projecttext6">
            This is the endresult of the backpack with the custom recipe and GUI.
